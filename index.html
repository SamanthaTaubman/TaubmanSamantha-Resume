        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marketing MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Samantha Taubman, and I am currently a first year at the University of California Riverside. I am studying business and I am planning to have my concentration be marketing. I have always enjoyed implementing creative elements in my daily life and make it a point to drive myself artistically. 
One such method I have done this is through owning my own jewelry shop through Etsy. Initially started as a way to pass time during quarantine, I soon realized the responsibilities and determination it takes to maintain oneâ€™s own business. As more feedback and orders came my way, I began to take note of the pieces that were garnering the most views and orders and began to centralize my inventory around those statistics. Along with the products I sell, I also began to focus heavily on packaging as I noticed a large majority of my reviews centered around said packaging. As time passed on, I also began to market through tik tok, which brought me a large number of new customers that I still get feedback from. 
<br><br>

        Alongside my jewelry business, I have also worked a couple of jobs throughout the past couple of years, building my skills in customer service. My first job was working at a summer camp, teaching children between the ages of four to sixteen how to play tennis. Each week always brought in a new batch of kids, each group varying wildly from the rest. Patience and empathy were required for all the age groups as there were many campers struggling with emotions they were not too happy about. On numerous occasions as well, the children made it a personal mission to try and hit me with the rackets or tennis balls, as much as possible. Despite my duration of working at the summer camp being slightly less than ten weeks, I still learned how to resolve conflicts, empathize with the campers, and engage whenever they were having difficulties.<br><br>

        Another job that I gained valuable customer service skills from was working as a junior instructor at the San Dieguito Cotillion. At the San Dieguito Cotillion, junior instructors are expected to be the epitome of both etiquette and proper ballroom dancing techniques. In the span of my two years of working there, I honed my skills and garnered an appreciation for organization, timeliness, and class. I was able to socialize with many different people my age from San Diego and the surrounding area as a junior instructor.
